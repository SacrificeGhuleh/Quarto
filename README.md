# Quarto
Quarto is a board game for two players invented by Swiss mathematician Blaise Müller in 1991. 

The game is played on a 4×4 board. There are 16 unique pieces, each of which is either:
* tall or short;
* black or white;
* square or circular;
* hollow-top or solid-top.

Players take turns choosing a piece which the other player must then place on the board. A player wins by placing a piece on the board which forms a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row of four pieces, all of which have a common attribute (all short, all circular, etc.). A variant rule included in many editions gives a second way to win by placing four matching pieces in a 2x2 square.
Quarto is distinctive in that there is only one set of common pieces, rather than a set for one player and a different set for the other. It is therefore an impartial game.
